# OpenMAG - Open Mac Assistant GUI
A opensource demo of an assistant capable of understanding your computer.

I created OpenMAG as a simple demo of potential capabilities of Apple Intellegence. Of course OpenMAG does not fill all of Apple Intellegence's claims, but it serves to show a simplified way of interacting with your computer.

All Xcode files and a signed copy of the app is found here.

# How it works:

When a request is sent, OpenMAG uses the free [Groq API](https://console.groq.com/) to accses Llama 3.1 70b and Llama 3.1 Instant. The 70b model is used to generate bash based on the users query. The Instant model is used in order to respond to the users query in natural language.

A [free Groq API key](https://console.groq.com) is required to use OpenMAG
